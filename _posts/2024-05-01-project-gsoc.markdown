description: I was awarded this stipend to expand the repertoire of open-source tools for analysing effective connectivity in electrophysiological data in the MNE-Python ecosystem. This includes the development of a new decoding module in MNE-Connectivity for the real-time, data-driven analysis of high-dimensional data, as well as the addition of statistical tools to distinguish genuine interactions from background noise. <a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/QptYlp9M>Project details here</a>.
