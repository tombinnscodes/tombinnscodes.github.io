description: I developed machine learning-based pipelines for online and offline analyses of electrophysiological data in brain-computer interface paradigms in the lab of Prof. John-Dylan Haynes at the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Berlin. I additionally performed extensive analysis of this data for the study of human motor control and decision making.
