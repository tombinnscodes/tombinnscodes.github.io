description: I am the lead developer and maintainer of <a href=https://pybispectra.readthedocs.io/en/main/>PyBispectra</a>, an open-source Python package for performing advanced non-linear signal analysis using the bispectrum. There is support for analysing cross-frequency coupling (amplitude-amplitude, phase-phase, and phase-amplitude coupling), frequency-domain wave shape features, as well as time delay estimations between signals. The package uses multiprocessing and Numba-based C compilation for rapid, computationally efficient signal processing.
