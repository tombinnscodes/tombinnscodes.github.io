description: I am a maintainer of <a href=https://mne.tools/mne-connectivity/stable/index.html>MNE-Connectivity</a>, a signal analysis toolbox in the MNE ecosystem with over 2,600 stars on GitHub, and citations in over 4,000 peer-reviewed scientific papers. My contributions have involved the addition of new features, bug fixes, publishing releases, project maintenance, and user support. This has included the implementation of several advanced, multivariate signal processing methods, as well as a Google Summer of Code project to implement a connectivity decoding module for real-time, data-driven analysis of high-dimensional data alongside statistical tools for distinguishing genuine interactions from background noise.
