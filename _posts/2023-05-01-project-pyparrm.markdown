description: I am the lead developer and maintainer of <a href=https://pyparrm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>PyPARRM</a>, an open-source Python implementation of the PARRM algorithm for removing stimulation artefacts from electrophysiological recordings. This package is equipped with multiprocessing support for rapid signal processing, as well as an extensive interactive visualisation tool for exploring the effects of different filter parameters on the data.
